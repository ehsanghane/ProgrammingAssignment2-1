# The following function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" created
# with the makeCacheMatrix function. However, it first checks to see if the
# inverse has already been calculated. If so, it  get s the mean from the cache
# and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and
# sets the value of the mean in the cache via the  setmean  function.
